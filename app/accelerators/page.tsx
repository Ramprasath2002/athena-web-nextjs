          <h2>Reimagining ECO Change with Automation</h2>

          <p>
            Engineering changes are a part of growth—but executing them
            shouldn’t slow you down.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Athena, we’ve developed a suite of automation accelerators
            <strong>
              {" "}
              specifically engineered to work seamlessly within MES environments
            </strong>
            , streamlining every step of the ECO process.
          </p>

          <p>
            From smart validations to cross-system data migration and automated
            testing, our tools bring precision, speed, and transparency to
            change implementation— while also generating downloadable reports
            for audit, compliance, and traceability.
