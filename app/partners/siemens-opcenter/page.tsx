                The <strong> Factory MES System</strong> has become the heart of
                the Industry 4.0 / Smart Factory trend. Unlike ERP / SFC
                systems, MES Systems effectively Control and Track the flow of
                Product in the factory with full traceability. MES Systems also
                intelligently communicate with Factory Equipment, Automation
                Cells and a variety of Quality and other Factory Applications,
                resulting in a more Automated Production Process. At Athena,
                Siemens Opcenter MES is the Centerpiece of our MOM Consulting
                Practice. With Siemens, a well established leader in MOM /
                Manufacturing Operations Management, we are likewise proud to be
                a Siemens Strategic Alliance Partner.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-6">
                <strong>Factory Systems Integration</strong> creates intelligent
                connections between Factory Systems and Factory Assets. The key
                is to first align around the Production Life Cycle and then to
                digitally connect all the Digitally capable Assets within for
                each Operational step. In the Smart Factory, PLM, ERP, MES and
                CMMS are integrated along their respective process life Cycles.
                Likewise, to gain the value of a Smart Factory, the MES System
                is also integrated with; Factory Equipment, Quality Systems,
                Automation Controls and other Digitally capable Factory Systems
                to achieve orders of magnitude in Production benefits. These
                include; Higher Yield, Increased Production output, reduced
                human dependencies and Product cost.{" "}
                <strong>

              Industry 4.0 Smart Factory Analytics add enormous value to the
              Manufacturing Enterprise versus historical reporting platforms.
              Smart Factory Analytics collect data from factory digital assets
              and systems enabling production visibility in real-time,
              trend-based, descriptive and predictive formats.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the key benefits is driving production toward KPI targets
              and enabling accurate root cause analysis. Organizations strive
              for yield, equipment utilization, and quality performance.
            </p>

              Smart Factory Analytics provide daily cycles of learning with
